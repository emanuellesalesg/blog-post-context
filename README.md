# Blog Post App

This project is a simple blog post application built using context, reducer, hook, and effect in React. It allows users to create and delete posts, as well as providing an updated count of posts. The application was developed using TypeScript to ensure greater security and maintainability of the code.

## Key Features:

- **Context**: Used to manage the global state of the application and provide relevant information to all components.
- **Reducer**: Responsible for controlling changes in the application state, ensuring a predictable and consistent approach.
- **Hook and Effect**: Used to interact with the lifecycle of components and perform asynchronous operations, such as saving and loading data.
- **LocalStorage**: Employed to store posts locally in the user's browser, allowing posts to persist between sessions.

## Simple Design:

The design of the application has been deliberately kept simple, with the primary goal of providing an environment conducive to experimentation and study of the concepts mentioned above. This project serves as a solid foundation for expanding and enhancing your skills in front-end development with React.

## Technologies Used:

- React
- TypeScript
- LocalStorage
